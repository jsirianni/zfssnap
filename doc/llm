## Style Guide

- Review and follow the Uber Go Style Guide for all Go code in this repository: [Uber Go Style Guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uber-go/guide/refs/heads/master/style.md)

LLMs working on this project must read this file fully and apply the style guide when writing Go code.

### Additional Guidance for this Repository

- Avoid obvious comments. Do not comment on trivial or idiomatic patterns (e.g., wrapping a context with a timeout, basic error returns, simple getters/setters). Prefer self-explanatory code and comments that capture non-obvious rationale, invariants, or edge cases. This aligns with the spirit of the Uber guideâ€™s emphasis on clarity and avoiding clutter.
